HTTP REQUESTS

- Make HTTP requests to get data from another server
- We make these requests to API endpoints


Ex. 

http://www.musicapi.com/artist/moby

  OUR      (HTTP Request) --->    SOME OTHER
WEBSITE  <---- (Response (data))   SERVER


Components of a HTTP Request

URL - Specifies the resource location
Headers - Contain metadata (authentication, content type, etc.)
Body - Includes data for methods like POST & PUT


HTTP Methods

GET - Retrieve data from a server
POST - Send data to a server (e.g., form submission)
PUT - Update existing data on a server

API Lifecycle

1. Design
    Define endpoints, request/response format, authentication
    Use tools like Swagger or Postman
2. Development
    Implement API using backend technologies (e.g. Node.js, Express, Django)
3. Testing
    Use tools like Postman or Jest
4. Deployment
    Host on platforms like Vercel, Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean
