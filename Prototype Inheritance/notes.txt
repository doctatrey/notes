PROTOTYPE INHERITANCE 

Prototype Inheritance is a concept in JavaScript that allows object to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
Unlike class-based inheritance in languages like Java or C++, JS uses a prototype-based approach


BASICS

In JS, every object has a hidden property called [[Prototype]] (also accessible via __proto__), which points to
another object called its prototype. When you try to access a property or method that doesn't exist on an object, JavaScript 
automatically looks for it in the object's prototype, then in the prototype's prototype, and so on, forming what's called the 
"prototype chain."
