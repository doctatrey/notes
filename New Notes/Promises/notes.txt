PROMISE

The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an 
asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A promise is in one of the following states:
pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
fulfilled: the operation was completed successfully
rejected: the operation failed

The promise object supports two properties: state and result 
While a promise is "pending" (working), the result is undefined
When a promise is "fulfilled:, the result is a value
When the Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object

myPromise.state = "pending" --> myPromise.result = undefined
myPromise.state = "fulfilled" --> myPromise.result = a result value
myPromise.state = "rejected" --> myPromise.result = an error object
