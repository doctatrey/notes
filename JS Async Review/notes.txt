Evolution of Async Patterns in JS

1. Callbacks
The original approach to handling async operations

Challenges:
    * Callback hell (nested callbacks) - leads to code that's difficult to read and maintain
    * Error handling complexity - required checking for errors in each callback
    * Inversion of control - you hand control of your program to another function

2. Promises 
Introduced to solve callback issues with a more structures approach

3. Async / Await
Syntactic sugar over promises for more readable code
